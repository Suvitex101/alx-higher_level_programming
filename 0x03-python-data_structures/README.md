# Python - Data Structures

This project contains Python programs that demonstrate the usage of data structures such as lists and tuples. Each script focuses on a specific task related to manipulating and working with these data structures.

| 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py | Prints all integers in a list in reverse order.                                                   |
| 4-new_in_list.py             | Replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.          |
| 5-no_c.py                    | Removes all occurrences of the letter 'c' (both lowercase and uppercase) from a given string.     |
| 6-print_matrix_integer.py    | Prints a matrix of integers.                                                                       |
| 7-add_tuple.py               | Adds two tuples together and returns the result.                                                   |
| 8-multiple_returns.py        | Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.                               |
| 9-max_integer.py             | Finds the maximum integer in a list.                                                               |
| 10-divisible_by_2.py         | Determines whether each element in a list is divisible by 2 and returns the result.                |
| 11-delete_at.py              | Deletes an element from a list at a specific position.                                             |
